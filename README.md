Liveblog-o-matic
================

A quick (and sloppy) hack to fetch the latest liveblogs from the Guardian (can't 
trust the flag in the AIP that tells you if it's current or not) and then display
them broken down into blocks.

+   Running: liveblogomatic.appspot.com [now offline] [Screenshot here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/revdancatt/5266719192)

ToDo
====

+   Improve parsing of page to break down blocks correctly, extract "non-blocks"
+   Improve scrolling to not faff around
+   Post to twitter when there's a new livelbog found
